# Takhfifan Little BootCamp

Hopefully we will try to take some little steps to learn how to become
a developer.

We would try pair-programming, to learn how to deal with others, and
make coding hopefully easier, and faster in a long term.

## Session 1

We get ourselves familiar with some basics of Ruby in a Test-Driven approach.
There would some tests that we, as pairs, try to make them pass, after a
brief introduction on related stuff that we need to know, like functions,
and loops. To make it as boring as possible, it would do some science!
