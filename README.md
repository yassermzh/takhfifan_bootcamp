# Takhfifan Little BootCamp

Hopefully we will try to take some little steps to learn how to become
a developer.

We would try pair-programming, to learn how to deal with others, and
make coding hopefully easier, and faster in a long term.

## Session 1

We get ourselves familiar with some basics of Ruby in a test driven approach.
There would be some tests that we, as pairs, try to make them pass, after a
brief introduction on related stuff that we need to know, like functions,
and loops. To make it as boring as possible, it would do some science!

### Session 2

We get familiar with APIs. A bit on REST API, how Takhfifan's private API
is not REST. We play with HTTP clients: command-line httpie, and Ruby's Faraday,
to get main deals of Takhfifan after getting session key.

Also, there is a bit introduction to databases, and doing some queries
fetching and visualizing results, like how much Takhfifan earned per city.
